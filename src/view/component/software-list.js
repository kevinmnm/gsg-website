      desc: `Razer Cortex: Boost is perhaps the most well-known and used game booster on the market. It boosts the performance of your PC by allowing you to shut down any application you do not need while you are gaming. Killing background apps allows your computer to focus its GPU, RAM, CPU, and other resources on running the game you are playing.

      Gamers using this program should expect to see higher FPS and quicker load time.
      
      You have the option to allow Razer Cortex to auto-boost. In other words, simply opening a game from Origin, Battlenet, Steam, etc will automatically initiate the boost from Cortex.
      
      This makes Razer Cortex a highly convenient and easy to use a game booster.
      
      On the other hand, you can choose to personally tailor your settings. This is ideal for users who are computer savvy.
      
      There are many other features of Razer Cortex that are not related to boosting.
